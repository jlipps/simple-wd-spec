# The W3C WebDriver Spec: A Simplified Guide

This document is essentially a cheat sheet for the official [WebDriver spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) (which has in-progress drafts available [on GitHub](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html)). The official spec is designed for implementers to have very detailed information about processing algorithms and so on. Much of the information in the spec is not targeted towards those who are simply writing client libraries, or even users who want a closer look at the API. It also uses language which is so exact it can sometimes obfuscate an intuitive understanding of a section.

The approach used here is to simply look at the supported endpoints along with their inputs and outputs, without worrying too much how the implementation is supposed to work. This should be beneficial to client library implementers as well as remote end implementers looking for some quick highlights. And in most cases there are examples to illustrate

**DISCLAIMER**: This is _not_ the official spec. It is my interpretation of it and an attempt to present the most salient bits of it in a more digestible fashion. You should always consult the official spec before beginning work on a client or server implementation!

## Introduction

What is WebDriver? From the spec:

> WebDriver is a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.

Essentially, it's a client-server protocol that allows you to automate web browsers. Clients send well-formed requests, the server interprets them according to the protocol, and then performs the automation behaviors as defined by the implementation steps in the spec. The most common use of this technology is for automated testing.

The WebDriver spec grew out of the [Selenium](https://seleniumhq.org) project, and that is still the community of users pushing forward the associated browser automation technology and using it every day to write and run automated tests. Browser vendors now also support the WebDriver spec natively.

WebDriver has gone beyond the web, with implementations for mobile and desktop app automation. The [Appium](https://appium.io) project is a set of WebDriver-compliant servers that allow automation of these non-web-browser platforms.

### Basic Architecture

Automation is organized around WebDriver _sessions_, whose state is maintained across requests via a 'session id' token shared by the server and client. Creating a new session involves sending parameters in the form of _capabilities_, which tell the server what you want to automate and under what conditions. The server prepares the appropriate browser with any modifications as specified in the capabilities, and the session is then underway. Automation commands and responses are sent back and forth (keyed on the session id), until the client sends a request to delete the session, at which point the browser and other resources are quit or cleaned up, and the session id is discarded.

## Requests and Responses

### Overview

When the client (called a `local end`) sends a request to the server (called a `remote end`), this is known in the spec as a 'command'. Since this is an HTTP protocol, commands have several components:

* An HTTP verb
* A path

The remote end at this point looks up the command based on the HTTP verb and path. The spec defines [a list of endpoints](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#list-of-endpoints) that map verb + path to a command name. The path portion is actually a list of "URI Templates" that show how path components should be extracted as parameters for the command. For example, in:

```
/session/{session id}/element
```

The `{session id}` bit is saying that this component of the path is a "url variable" called `session id` whose value will be sent to the command (in this case `Find Element`). Once a command is matched to the request, other data is potentially parsed from the request body (these are the "parameters"), the command is executed (having been passed any url variables and request parameters), and a response is returned.

### Request format and handling

A request from the local end to the remote end is a valid HTTP request, with a verb, path, and potentially a body. As mentioned above, the remote end validates the request and attempts to map it to a command. If the request can't be mapped to a command, an `unknown method` error is returned (see below for what it means to return an error).

There is one command (`New Session`) which does not require a `session id` url variable. Every other command requires this variable, since every other command is executed in the context of an existing session. If we are not requesting a new session, the remote end immediately validates the session id against the list of active sessions. If it's not found, an `invalid session id` error is returned.

In the case of a `POST` request, the local end might have sent data in the request body. This data must always be JSON data. The remote end first parses it as JSON (if this fails, an `invalid argument` error is returned). If the result of the parse is not a JSON object (i.e., if it's a string or array or number or what have you), an `invalid argument` is likewise returned. Otherwise, the result of parsing is the set of "parameters" which is passed to the command.

(In the case of a `POST` request without a request body, the "parameters" value is `null`.)

### Response format

When a remote end sends an HTTP response, it first of all uses an appropriate HTTP status code and message (for example, `404` and `no such element`), based on the command that was attempted and the result. The spec defines status codes and messages for various responses, including success and error conditions (see below).

It then sets the following headers:

* `Content-Type`: `"application/json; charset=utf-8"`
* `Cache-Control`: `"no-cache"`

If any data needs to be returned with the response, it is serialized into a JSON object with the key `value`, e.g.:

```json
{"value": null}
```

And this becomes the body of the HTTP response.

### Normal responses

When an error has not occurred, the HTTP status is `200`, and the response body is the appropriate JSON object with the response data in the `value` property of the JSON object.

### Error handling

When an error occurs, the remote end first of all determines the appropriate error code and corresponding HTTP status code (see below for the full list). For example, if an element could not be found, the error code is `no such element` and the corresponding HTTP status code is `404`. The remote end then constructs a data JSON object with the properties `error`, `message`, and `stacktrace`. Here `error` is just the JSON code for the error (see table below; usually the same as the error code itself). `message` is whatever implementation-specific error message is appropriate. And likewise `stacktrace` is an implementation-specific stacktrace useful to implementation maintainers in diagnosing any issues.

An example error JSON object could look like:

```json
{
  "error": "no such element",
  "message": "My fake implementation couldn't find your element",
  "stacktrace": "Fake:21> Not a real stacktrace"
}
```

Since this JSON object becomes the data for the response, the full response from the remote end would be an HTTP status code of `404`, the headers listed above, and finally the following JSON string as the response body:

```json
{
  "value": {
    "error": "no such element",
    "message": "My fake implementation couldn't find your element",
    "stacktrace": "Fake:21> Not a real stacktrace"
   }
}
```

### Error codes

The following is a list of all the possible errors, their HTTP status codes, and their JSON error codes:

|Error code|HTTP Status|JSON code|Description|

|unsupported operation|500|unsupported operation|Indicates that a command that should have executed properly cannot be supported for some reason.|

## The Endpoints

In this section, we go through each endpoint and examine its inputs and outputs and potential errors. The conventions I use are:

* "URL variables": variable strings slotted into URI templates
* "Request parameters": properties of the JSON object in the request body. Could be "None", which means no body
* "Response value": the value of the `value` property of the response body, when that is a single, non-object value.
* "Response properties": properties of a JSON object which is the value of the `value` property of the response body. For example, in this JSON response body:
    
    ```json
    {"value": {"foo": "bar"}}
    ```
    
    I'm calling `foo` a "response property" with a value of `"bar"`.
* "Possible errors": errors and codes it's possible for the command to return in case of an error specific to that command. Note that regardless of what's in this list, it's always possible for some errors to occur (e.g., `invalid session id` or `unknown error`. As another example, most endpoints attempt to handle user prompts in the course of operation, which might result in `unexpected alert open`. See [Handling User Prompts](#handling-user-prompts) for more information). A value of "None" here means "no particularly relevant errors", not that it's not possible for an error to occur!

	* `session id`
	* `element id`: the id of an element returned in a previous call to Find Element(s)
* **Request parameters:** 
	* None
* **Response value:**
	* `null`
	* Example:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": null
		}
		```
* **Possible errors:**
	* `no such window` (`400`) if the top level browsing context is not open
	* `stale element reference` (`404`) if the element is stale

### Element Send Keys

|HTTP Method|Path Template|
|-----------|-------------|
|POST|/session/{session id}/element/{element id}/value|

[Spec description](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#element-send-keys):
> The `Element Send Keys` command scrolls into view the form control element and then sends the provided keys to the element. In case the element is not keyboard-interactable, an element not interactable error is returned.
>
> The key input state used for input may be cleared mid-way through "typing" by sending the null key, which is U+E000 (NULL).

* **URL variables:**
	* `session id`
	* `element id`: the id of an element returned in a previous call to Find Element(s)
* **Request parameters:** 
	* `text`: string to send as keystrokes to the element. There are three basic possibilities for what happens with this:
		* If the element is a text input box: `text` is typed as an appendix to existing text.
		* If the element is a file input control: `text` is split on newlines (`\n`) and considered a list of files to select. The files must actually exist.
		* If the element is rendered as something other than a text input control: `text` is set as the `value` property of the control.
	* Example:
	
		```json
		{"text": "hello world"}
		```
		
* **Response value:**
	* `null`
	* Example:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": null
		}
		```
* **Possible errors:**
	* `no such window` (`400`) if the top level browsing context is not open
	* `stale element reference` (`404`) if the element is stale
	* `invalid argument` (`400`) if the `text` request parameter is not a string, or if the element is a file input and actual files are not sent, or if the element is has a non-standard UI and is suffering from bad input after being set
	* `invalid element state` (`400`) if the element is (a) neither content editable nor both editable and resettable, or (b) disabled, read-only, or has pointer events disabled
	* `element not interactable` (`400`) if the element does not become keyboard-interactable after the implicit wait timeout, or if the element has a non-standard UI and no `value` property to set

### Get Page Source

|HTTP Method|Path Template|

### Execute Script

|HTTP Method|Path Template|
|-----------|-------------|
|POST|/session/{session id}/execute/sync|

[Spec description](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#execute-script):
> The `Execute Script` command executes a JavaScript function in the context of the current browsing context and returns the return value of the function.

* **URL variables:**
	* `session id`
* **Request parameters:** 
	* `script`: A string, the Javascript function body you want executed. Note that this is the function _body_, not a function _definition_. What happens is that `script` is parsed as a JS function body, and if this parsing succeeds, an internal function is created with this body. The function is then `call`ed with `window` as the context, and any arguments you provided applied as well (see next parameter). This whole process is wrapped in `Promise.resolve`, so if your script returns a Promise, its fulfillment (or rejection) will propagate to the return value of this command. If you want a return value of your script to be passed to the local end, you'll need to explicitly `return` in your script.
	* `args`: An array of JSON values which will be deserialized and passed as arguments to your function (accessible via the JS `arguments` array). Note that WebDriver element references may be passed in their object form, and they will be deserialized to actual web elements in your function.
	* Example 1:

		```json
		{
		  "script": "let [num1, num2] = arguments; return num1 + num2;",
		  "args": [5, 6]
		}
		```
	
	* Example 2:

		```json
		{
		  "script": "let name = arguments[0]; return new Promise((resolve, reject) => { window.setTimeout(() => { resolve('hello ' + name); }, 1000); });",
		  "args": ["world"]
		}
		```
		
	* Example 3:

		```json
		{
		  "script": "throw new Error('boo');",
		  "args": []
		}
		```
		
* **Response value:**
	* Either the return value of your script, the fulfillment of the Promise returned by your script, or the error which was the reason for your script's returned Promise's rejection.
	* Example 1:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": 11
		}
		```
		
	* Example 2:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": "hello world"
		}
		```
		
	* Example 3:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": {
		    "error": "boo",
		    "message": "boo",
		    "stacktrace": "at <anonymous:1:11>"
		  }
		}
		```
		
* **Possible errors:**
	* `no such window` (`400`) if the top level browsing context is not open
	* `javascript error` (`500`) if `script` could not be parsed as a function body, or if the function completes abruptly, or if the script results in a Promise rejected with any reason other than an error
	* `timeout` (`408`) if the script does not generate a return value or completed Promise by the time the `session script timeout` elapses

### Execute Async Script

|HTTP Method|Path Template|
|-----------|-------------|
|POST|/session/{session id}/execute/async|

[Spec description](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#execute-async-script):
> The `Execute Async Script` command causes JavaScript to execute as an anonymous function. Unlike the Execute Script command, the result of the function is ignored. Instead an additional argument is provided as the final argument to the function. This is a function that, when called, returns its first argument as the response.

* **URL variables:**
	* `session id`
* **Request parameters:** 
	* `script`: A string, the Javascript function body you want executed. Note that this is the function _body_, not a function _definition_. What happens is that `script` is parsed as a JS function body, and if this parsing succeeds, an internal function is created with this body. The function is then `call`ed with `window` as the context, and any arguments you provided applied as well (see next parameter). In addition, a callback function reference is appended to the list of arguments, available as the last item in the `arguments` list. When this function is called in your script, the first parameter to it is returned as the result of this command.
	* `args`: An array of JSON values which will be deserialized and passed as arguments to your function (accessible via the JS `arguments` array). Note that WebDriver element references may be passed in their object form, and they will be deserialized to actual web elements in your function.
	* Example 1:

		```json
		{
		  "script": "let [num1, num2, cb] = arguments; cb(num1 + num2);",
		  "args": [5, 6]
		}
		```
	
	* Example 2:

		```json
		{
		  "script": "let [name, cb] = arguments; window.setTimeout(() => { cb('hello ' + name); }, 1000);",
		  "args": ["world"]
		}
		```
		
* **Response value:**
	* The JSON serialization of the value of the first parameter sent to the callback function, or any error triggered during execution
	* Example 1:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": 11
		}
		```
		
	* Example 2:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": "hello world"
		}
		```
		
	* Example 3:
	
		```json
		{
		  "value": {
		    "error": "boo",
		    "message": "boo",
		    "stacktrace": "at <anonymous:1:11>"
		  }
		}
		```
		
* **Possible errors:**
	* `no such window` (`400`) if the top level browsing context is not open
	* `javascript error` (`500`) if `script` could not be parsed as a function body, or if the function completes abruptly, or if the script results in a Promise rejected with any reason other than an error

### Perform Actions

|HTTP Method|Path Template|
|-----------|-------------|
|POST|/session/{session id}/actions|

[Spec link](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#perform-actions).

Actions are a very complex portion of the spec. Some preliminary understanding of concepts is useful:

* **tick**: a slice of an action chain. Actions from different input sources can be executed simultaneously. These are first lined up from the first action. Every vertical "slice" across the different input sources' action lists is a tick. A tick is not associated with any particular time value, and lasts as long as the longest action duration inside the tick.
* **input source**: a representation of an input device like a keyboard, mouse, finger, or pen. There can be any number of input sources. Each one has its own `id`.
* **action**: a behavior performed by an input source. Different types of input source have different types of possible actions

#### Input Sources and Corresponding Actions

* `null` input source
	* `pause`: "Used with an integer argument to specify the duration of a tick, or as a placeholder to indicate that an input source does nothing during a particular tick."
* `key` input source
	* `pause`: same as for `null`
	* `keyDown`: "Used to indicate that a particular key should be held down."
	* `keyUp`: "Used to indicate that a depressed key should be released."
* `pointer` input source. This kind also has a `pointer type` specifying which kind of pointer it is (which can be `mouse`, `pen`, or `touch`):
	* `pause`: same as for `null`
	* `pointerDown`: "Used to indicate that a pointer should be depressed in some way e.g. by holding a button down (for a mouse) or by coming into contact with the active surface (for a touch or pen device)."
	* `pointerUp`: "Used to indicate that a pointer should be released in some way e.g. by releasing a mouse button or moving a pen or touch device away from the active surface."
	* `pointerMove`: "Used to indicate a location on the screen that a pointer should move to, either in its active (pressed) or inactive state."
	* `pointerCancel`: "Used to cancel a pointer action."

* **URL variables:**
	* `session id`
* **Request parameters:** 
	* `actions`: a list of input source actions. In other words, a list of objects, each of which represents an input source and its associated actions. Each input source must have the following properties:
		* `type`: String, one of `pointer`, `key`, or `none`
		* `id`: String, a unique id chosen to represent this input source for this and future actions
		* (Pointer-type input sources can also have a `parameters` property, which is an object with a `pointerType` key specifying either `mouse`, `pen`, or `touch`. If `parameters` is omitted, the `pointerType` is considered to be `mouse`.)
		* `actions`: a list of action objects for this particular input source. An action object has different fields based on the kind of input device it belongs to:
			* null input sources:
				* `type`: can only be the string `pause`
				* `duration`: integer >= 0, representing time in milliseconds
			* pointer input sources:
				* `type`: string, one of the actions listed above (`pointerDown`, etc...).
				* If `pause`: integer property `duration` as above
				* If `pointerUp` or `pointerDown`: integer property `button` (>= 0, representing which button is pressed/released)
				* If `pointerMove`:
					* `duration`: integer in ms
					* `origin`: either (a) string, one of `viewport` or `pointer`, or (b) an object representing a web element. Defaults to `viewport` if `origin` is omitted.
					* `x`: integer, x-value to move to, relative to either viewport, pointer, or element based on `origin`
					* `y`: integer, y-value to move to, relative to either viewport, pointer, or element based on `origin`
				* If `pointerCancel`: this action is not yet defined by the spec
			* key input sources:
				* `type`: string, one of the actions listed above (`keyUp` or `keyDown`)
				* If `pause`: integer property `duration` as above
				* If `keyUp` or `keyDown`:
					* `value`: a string containing a single Unicode code point (any value in the Unicode code space). Basically, this is either a "normal" character like "A", or a Unicode code point like "\uE007" (Enter), which can include control characters.

	* Example 1 (expressing a 1-second pinch-and-zoom with a 500ms wait after the fingers first touch):
	
		```json
		{
		  "actions": [
		    {
		      "type": "pointer",
		      "id": "finger1",
		      "parameters": {"pointerType": "touch"},
		      "actions": [
		        {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 0, "x": 100, "y": 100},
		        {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 0},
		        {"type": "pause", "duration": 500},
		        {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 1000, "origin": "pointer", "x": -50, "y": 0},
		        {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 0}
		      ]
		    }, {
		      "type": "pointer",
		      "id": "finger2",
		      "parameters": {"pointerType": "touch"},
		      "actions": [
		        {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 0, "x": 100, "y": 100},
		        {"type": "pointerDown", "button": 0},
		        {"type": "pause", "duration": 500},
		        {"type": "pointerMove", "duration": 1000, "origin": "pointer", "x": 50, "y": 0},
		        {"type": "pointerUp", "button": 0}
		      ]
		    }
		  ]
		}
		```
		
	* Example 2 (equivalent to typing CTRL+S and releasing the keys, though releasing would be better performed by a call to `Release Actions`):
	
		```json
		{
		  "actions": [
		    {
		      "type": "key",
		      "id": "keyboard",
		      "actions": [
		        {"type": "keyDown", "value": "\uE009"},
		        {"type": "keyDown", "value": "s"},
		        {"type": "keyUp", "value": "\uE009"},
		        {"type": "keyUp", "value": "s"}
		      ]
		    }
		  ]
		}
		```
		
* **Response value:**
	* `null`
* **Possible errors:**
	* `no such window` (`400`) if the top level browsing context is not open
	* `invalid argument` (`400`) if `actions` is not an array, or if an action sequence is set which has a mismatched `pointerType`, or if the _inner_ `actions` is not an array, or in general if any of the requirements for parameter types and values described above are not met

### Capabilities

From [the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#capabilities):

> WebDriver *capabilities* are used to communicate the features supported by a given implementation.

Capabilities are used by the client (local end) in order to tell the remote end what it expects, and is also used by the remote end to tell the local end what it can do. In terms of structure, capabilities are simply a JSON object with keys and values (values which themselves can be objects). There are a set of "standard capabilities" that all remote ends must support:


|Capability|Key|Value Type|Description|
|----------|---|----------|-----------|
|Browser name|`browserName`|string|Identifies the user agent.|
|Browser version|`browserVersion`|string|Identifies the version of the user agent.|
|Platform name|`platformName`|string|Identifies the operating system of the endpoint node.|
|Accept insecure TLS certificates|`acceptInsecureCerts`|boolean|Indicates whether untrusted and self-signed TLS certificates are implicitly trusted on navigation for the duration of the session.|
|Page load strategy|`pageLoadStrategy`|string|Defines the current session’s page load strategy. Can be `none` (doesn't wait for readiness), `normal` (waits for document `interactive` state), or `eager` (waits for document `complete` state).|
|Proxy configuration|`proxy`|JSON Object|Defines the current session’s proxy configuration. This is a potentially complex object: see the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-proxy-configuration) for more info.|
|Window dimensioning/positioning|`setWindowRect`|boolean|Indicates whether the remote end supports all of the commands in Resizing and Positioning Windows.|
|Session timeouts configuration|`timeouts`|JSON Object|Describes the timeouts imposed on certain session operations, as described in the [Set Timeouts](#set-timeouts) command.|
|Unhandled prompt behavior|`unhandledPromptBehavior`|string|Describes the current session’s user [prompt handler](#handling-user-prompts).|

Remote ends can support capabilities beyond these, but they must be prefixed with a string followed by a colon, for example `moz:foobar`. This is therefore a possible set of capabilities (ignoring external structure detailed in the next section):

```json
{
  "browserName": "firefox",
  "browserVersion": "1234",
  "moz:foobar": true
 }
```

#### Processing Capabilities

During the execution of the [New Session](#new-session) command, the remote end looks at the `capabilities` object passed by the client, and attempts to process it in order to set up the correct automation environment. There is a complex [algorithm](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#processing-capabilities) that defines this process. The `capabilities` object always has two properties: `alwaysMatch` (a set of capabilities) and `firstMatch` (a list of sets of capabilities):

```json
{
  "capabilities": {
    "alwaysMatch": {...},
    "firstMatch": [{...}, ...]
  }
}
```

Basically, the remote end validates the `alwaysMatch` set and each set within the `firstMatch` list. Then it merges the `alwaysMatch` set with each of the `firstMatch` sets. Call each result of this process a "merged capabilities" object. (Note that the merge will error out with `invalid argument` if any capability in a `firstMatch` is already present in the `alwaysMatch` set.) The remote end then tries to match each merged capabilities object one-by-one. "Matching" is the process of ensuring that each capability can be unified with the remote end capability. For example, if a merged capability is `platformName` with a value of `mac`, but the remote end's `platformName` is `windows`, the set of merged capabilities it belongs to would not match. On the other hand, if both were `mac`, we would have a match. The process stops with the first match, which is then returned in the `New Session` response.

### Window Handles

Window Handles are strings representing a browsing context, whether top-level or not. The precise string is up to the remote end to generate, but it must not be the string `current`. See the [spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#dfn-window-handle) for more details.

### Handling User Prompts

User prompts are alerts, confirmation dialogs, etc..., that block the event loop and require interaction before control is returned to a browsing context. There are 2 ways these can be handled:

* By the Alert commands in the command list above (`Dismiss Alert`, `Accept Alert`, etc...)
* Automatically, by the remote end, when the user has specified an appropriate value for the `unhandledPromptBehavior` capability. Appropriate values can be one of the two strings `accept` and `dismiss`.

If the `unhandledPromptBehavior` capability is not set, then if a prompt is active, any command except for the Alert commands will result in an `unexpected alert open` error. This error may include a `text` property in the `data` field of the response, set to the text of the active prompt (in order to help with debugging).

If the `unhandledPromptBehavior` capability is set, then at various points in the session, if a prompt blocks the execution of one of the WebDriver algorithms, it will be automatically handled according to the capability:
	
* `accept` means to accept all user prompts/alerts
* `dismiss` means all alerts should be dismissed

See the [section in the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/#user-prompts) for more detailed algorithm.

### Location Strategies

[Location strategies](https://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html#locator-strategies) are used in conjunction with the [Find Element](#find-element) series of commands. They instruct the remote end which method to use to find an element using the provided locator. The valid locator strategies are:

|Strategy|Keyword|
|--------|-------|
|CSS selector|`css selector`|
|Link text selector|`link text`|
|Partial link text selector|`partial link text`|
|Tag name|`tag name`|
|XPath selector|`xpath`|
